/**
 * Purpose: Accumulates IRPatches produced by the structured workflow
 *   editor (Phase 7 forms) and provides the save pipeline that applies
 *   them to the on-disk YAML through the CST-preserving mutator path
 *   (Phase 8 ADR-11 gate).
 *
 *   Edit lifecycle:
 *     1. Phase 7 forms call `queuePatch()` for each user edit.
 *     2. UI reflects pending changes via `pendingPatches` / `dirty`.
 *     3. "Save" calls `applyAndSerialize(originalYaml)` to produce the
 *        new YAML; the caller writes it back to disk and then calls
 *        `clearPatches()`.
 *     4. "Discard" calls `clearPatches()` directly.
 *
 *   The store does NOT own the source YAML — that's `documentStore`
 *   for standalone files and Tiptap doc text for code-fence preview.
 *   This keeps the edit pipeline orthogonal to file I/O and makes the
 *   pipeline trivially testable.
 *
 * Plan: dev-docs/plans/20260504-github-actions-workflow-viewer.md §6
 *   Phase 8 / WI-8.3.
 *
 * Key decisions:
 *   - `preserveYamlFormatting` is a per-store flag (default true). Off
 *     path uses plain `yaml.stringify` for users who want reformatted
 *     output. Lifting to persistent settings is a Phase 9 polish item.
 *   - Patch queue is FIFO and replayed in order — last-write-wins for
 *     the same path, which matches how the forms editor accumulates
 *     edits during a session.
 *   - `applyAndSerialize()` is pure and synchronous — no fs I/O — so it
 *     can be unit-tested without mocks.
 *
