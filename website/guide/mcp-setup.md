# AI Integration (MCP)

VMark includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows AI assistants like Claude to interact directly with your editor.

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools and applications. VMark's MCP server exposes its editor capabilities as tools that AI assistants can use to:

- Read and write document content
- Apply formatting and create structures
- Navigate and manage documents
- Insert special content (math, diagrams, wiki links)

## Quick Setup

VMark makes it easy to connect AI assistants with one-click installation.

### 1. Enable MCP Server

Open **Settings → Integrations** and enable the MCP Server:

<div class="screenshot-container">
  <img src="/screenshots/mcp-settings-server.png" alt="VMark MCP Server Settings" />
</div>

- **Enable MCP Server** - Turn on to allow AI connections
- **Start on launch** - Auto-start when VMark opens
- **Auto-approve edits** - Apply AI changes without preview (see below)

### 2. Install Configuration

Click **Install** for your AI assistant:

<div class="screenshot-container">
  <img src="/screenshots/mcp-settings-install.png" alt="VMark MCP Install Configuration" />
</div>

Supported AI assistants:
- **Claude Desktop** - Anthropic's desktop app
- **Claude Code** - CLI for developers
- **Codex CLI** - OpenAI's coding assistant
- **Gemini CLI** - Google's AI assistant

::: info Other MCP-Compatible Clients
Other MCP-compatible clients such as Cursor, Windsurf, and similar tools can also connect to VMark's MCP server. Configure them manually by pointing to the MCP server binary path (see [Manual Configuration](#manual-configuration) below).
:::

#### Status Icons

Each provider shows a status indicator:

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| ✓ Green | Valid | Configuration is correct and working |
| ⚠ Amber | Path Mismatch | VMark was moved — click **Repair** |
| ✗ Red | Binary Missing | MCP binary not found — reinstall VMark |
| ○ Gray | Not Configured | Not installed — click **Install** |

::: tip VMark Moved?
If you move VMark.app to a different location, the status will show amber "Path Mismatch". Simply click the **Repair** button to update the configuration with the new path.
:::

### 3. Restart Your AI Assistant

After installing or repairing, **restart your AI assistant** completely (quit and reopen) to load the new configuration. VMark will show a reminder after each configuration change.

### 4. Try It Out

In your AI assistant, try commands like:
- *"What's in my VMark document?"*
- *"Write a summary of quantum computing to VMark"*
- *"Add a table of contents to my document"*

## See It in Action

Ask Claude a question and have it write the answer directly to your VMark document:

<div class="screenshot-container">
  <img src="/screenshots/mcp-claude.png" alt="Claude Desktop using VMark MCP" />
  <p class="screenshot-caption">Claude Desktop calls <code>document</code> → <code>set_content</code> to write to VMark</p>
</div>

<div class="screenshot-container">
  <img src="/screenshots/mcp-result.png" alt="Content rendered in VMark" />
  <p class="screenshot-caption">The content appears instantly in VMark, fully formatted</p>
</div>

<!-- Styles in style.css -->

## Manual Configuration

If you prefer to configure manually, here are the config file locations:

### Claude Desktop

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmark": {
      "command": "/Applications/VMark.app/Contents/MacOS/vmark-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Edit `~/.claude.json` or project `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmark": {
      "command": "/Applications/VMark.app/Contents/MacOS/vmark-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Codex CLI

Edit `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.vmark]
command = "/Applications/VMark.app/Contents/MacOS/vmark-mcp-server"
```

### Gemini CLI

Edit `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vmark": {
      "command": "/Applications/VMark.app/Contents/MacOS/vmark-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

::: tip Finding the Binary Path
On macOS, the MCP server binary is inside VMark.app:
- `VMark.app/Contents/MacOS/vmark-mcp-server`

On Windows:
- `C:\Program Files\VMark\vmark-mcp-server.exe`

On Linux:
- `/usr/bin/vmark-mcp-server` (or where you installed it)

The port is auto-discovered — no `args` needed.
:::

### CLI flags (advanced)

The MCP server binary supports a small set of flags for diagnostics and legacy setups:

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--version` (or `-v`) | Print the version (must match the running VMark) and exit. |
| `--health-check` | Run a self-test against the running VMark bridge and exit. Use this to verify your install before wiring an AI assistant. |
| `--port <number>` | Manual port override. Skip the auto-discovery handshake and connect on the given port. Only useful for legacy setups where the bridge port is fixed externally; the auto-discovery path is preferred. |

Example:

```bash
vmark-mcp-server --health-check
vmark-mcp-server --version
vmark-mcp-server --port 9223   # legacy / manual
```

## How It Works

```text
AI Assistant <--stdio--> MCP Server <--WebSocket--> VMark Editor
```

1. **VMark starts a WebSocket bridge** on an available port when launched
2. **The MCP server** reads the port and auth token from VMark's app data directory
3. **The MCP server** connects and authenticates via the WebSocket bridge
4. **AI assistant** communicates with the MCP server via stdio
5. **Commands are relayed** to VMark's editor through the bridge

## Available Capabilities

When connected, your AI assistant can:

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|-------------|
| **Document** | Read/write content, search, replace |
| **Selection** | Get/set selection, replace selected text |
| **Formatting** | Bold, italic, code, links, and more |
| **Blocks** | Headings, paragraphs, code blocks, quotes |
| **Lists** | Bullet, ordered, and task lists |
| **Tables** | Insert, modify rows/columns |
| **Special** | Math equations, Mermaid diagrams, wiki links |
| **Workspace** | Open/save documents, manage windows |

See the [MCP Tools Reference](/guide/mcp-tools) for complete documentation.

## Checking MCP Status

VMark provides multiple ways to check the MCP server status:

### Status Bar Indicator

The status bar shows an **MCP** indicator on the right side:

| Color | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Green | Connected and running |
| Gray | Disconnected or stopped |
| Pulsing (animated) | Starting up |

Startup typically completes within 1-2 seconds.

Click the indicator to open the detailed status dialog.

### Status Dialog

Access via **Help → MCP Server Status** or click the status bar indicator.

The dialog shows:
- Connection health (Healthy / Error / Stopped)
- Bridge running state and port
- Server version
- Available tools (12) and resources (4)
- Last health check time
- Full list of available tools with copy button

### Settings Panel

In **Settings → Integrations**, when the server is running you'll see:
- Version number
- Tool and resource counts
- **Test Connection** button — runs a health check
- **View Details** button — opens the status dialog

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" or "No active editor"

- Ensure VMark is running and has a document open
- Check that the MCP Server is enabled in Settings → Integrations
- Verify the MCP bridge shows "Running" status
- Restart VMark if the connection was interrupted

### Path mismatch after moving VMark

If you moved VMark.app to a different location (e.g., from Downloads to Applications), the configuration will point to the old path:

1. Open **Settings → Integrations**
2. Look for the amber ⚠ warning icon next to affected providers
3. Click **Repair** to update the path
4. Restart your AI assistant

### Tools not appearing in AI assistant

- Restart your AI assistant after installing the configuration
- Verify the configuration was installed (check for green checkmark in Settings)
- Check your AI assistant's logs for MCP connection errors

### Commands fail with "No active editor"

- Make sure a document tab is active in VMark
- Click in the editor area to focus it
- Some commands require text to be selected first

## How Edits Work

The pruned MCP surface follows the read-write spine: AI assistants call `document.read` to get the current content + a revision token, reason about it, then call `document.write` with the new full content. The revision token guards against silent overwrites: if you typed in VMark while the AI was thinking, the write returns `STALE` and the AI re-reads.

For GitHub Actions workflow YAML files, the AI uses `workflow.apply_patch` instead — VMark's CST-aware mutators preserve comments, anchors, and key order that a raw text rewrite would lose.

There is no preview/approval step in the new surface. If you want to review every change, run an external git workflow (work on a branch, review the diff, commit when satisfied) — this gives you the same control with industry-standard tools.

## Security Notes

- The MCP server only accepts local connections (localhost)
- No data is sent to external servers
- All processing happens on your machine
- The WebSocket bridge is only accessible locally
