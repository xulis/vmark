# VMark Developer Documentation

## Active Docs (tracked in git)

- `dev-docs/architecture.md`: system architecture overview — C4 diagram, entry points, data flows, module map.
- `dev-docs/design-system.md`: design tokens, components, patterns (single source of truth).
- `dev-docs/css-reference.md`: visual QA reference document for CSS changes.
- `dev-docs/cjk-gotchas.md`: CJK formatter pitfalls — things that will bite you if you're not careful.
- `dev-docs/large-file-open-pipeline.md`: end-to-end pipeline for the large-file open UX — tiers, routing, forced Source mode, indeterminate indicator, and the perf tricks in TiptapEditor.
- `dev-docs/decisions/`: architecture decision records (ADRs).
  - `heading-ime-composition-fix.md`: How we fixed the WebKit heading IME split-block bug — 5 attempts, root cause analysis, and why prevention beats repair.

## Agent Configuration

- `AGENTS.md`: working agreement + required practices.
- `.claude/rules/`: engineering guardrails, TDD, UI consistency, design tokens, shortcuts.

## Website (User-Facing Docs)

- `website/guide/`: VitePress site for end-user documentation.
- See `.claude/rules/21-website-docs.md` for sync rules.

## Documentation Conventions

- Prefer a single source of truth for each topic.
- Date + status new documents (Active / Historical / Draft) to reduce ambiguity.
- Update docs in the same change that modifies behavior.
